**Venly** allows you to easily integrate your app to the Polygon blockchain, whether you already have an app integrated with Web3 or are building a new app from scratch. Venly provides a smooth and delightful experience for you and your users on both web & mobile.

Venly will help you interact with the Polygon network, create blockchain wallets, create different asset types such as fungible (ERC20), and non-fungible tokens (ERC721 and ERC1155), and interact with smart contracts. Next to a superior developer experience, you can give your users a user-friendly interface.

Each application is unique and has different needs, providing different ways of interacting with Venly. We recommend that web3 applications integrate the [Venly web3 provider](https://docs.venly.io/docs/web3js), others may use the [Venly Widget](https://docs.venly.io/docs/widget-overview).

## Key features

- Support web and mobile.
- Offers social logins.
- Offers fiat-on-ramp.
- Supports both Polygon and Ethereum.
- Supports NFTs (ERC721 and ERC1155) on Polygon.
- Easy to integrate using Web3.

## Getting started 

If you already support web3 technology, you can improve your application's UX by integrating the [Venly web3 provider](https://docs.venly.io/docs/web3js), a smart wrapper around the existing web3 Ethereum JavaScript API.

By using our [web3 provider](https://docs.venly.io/docs/web3js), you can leverage the full potential of Venly with minimal effort, and you will be able to onboard less tech-savvy users without making them leave your application or download third-party plugins. Integrating just takes two steps and 5 minutes!

**Don't support web3 yet?**

> Don't worry we've got you covered with our ðŸ“¦ [Venly - Widget](https://docs.venly.io/docs/widget-overview).

### Step 1: Add the library to your project

Install the library by downloading it to your project via NPM.

```javascript
npm i @venly/web3-provider
```

Alternatively, you could also include the library directly from a CDN.

```javascript

```

```javascript
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@venly/web3-provider/umd/index.js"></script>
```

## Step 2: Initialize the web3 provider

Add the following lines of code to your project, it will load the Venly web3 provider.

### Simple

```javascript
import Web3 from 'web3';
import { VenlyProvider } from '@venly/web3-provider';

const Venly = new VenlyProvider();
const options: VenlyProviderOptions = {
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
};

const provider = await Venly.createProvider(options);
const web3 = new Web3(provider);
```

### Advanced

```javascript
import Web3 from 'web3';
import { VenlyProvider } from '@venly/web3-provider';

const Venly = new VenlyProvider();
const options = {
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  environment: 'staging', //optional, production by default
  signMethod: 'POPUP', //optional, REDIRECT by default
  bearerTokenProvider: () => 'obtained_bearer_token', //optional, default undefined
  //optional: you can set an identity provider to be used when authenticating
  authenticationOptions: {
    idpHint: 'google'
  },
  secretType: 'ETHEREUM' //optional, ETHEREUM by default
};

const provider = await Venly.createProvider(options);
const web3 = new Web3(provider);
```

You can fetch wallets, and sign transactions, and messages.
